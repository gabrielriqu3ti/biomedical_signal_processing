# Biomedical Signal Processing

This project encapsulates some small projects developed in the course [PTC3456 - Biomedical Signals Processing](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?nomdis=&sgldis=PTC3456).

In each folder, there is a small project that helps to understand and simulate the human body and its signals.
