Goldman Equation

The Goldman Equation allows us to calculate the resting membrane potential for a given set of monovalent ions separated by a phospholipid membrane with ion channels selectively permeable to these ions and is given by:

E_r = (R * T / F) * ln((P_K+ * [K+]out + P_Na+ * [Na+]out + P_Cl- * [Cl-]in) / (P_K+ * [K+]in + P_Na+ * [Na+]in + P_Cl- * [Cl-]out))

- E_r = resting membrane potential
- R = gas constant
- T = absolute temperature
- z = charge of that ion
- F = Faraday's constant
- ln = natural logarithm
- [K+]out = concentration of potassium outside the cell
- [Na+]out = concentration of sodium outside the cell
- [Cl-]out = concentration of cloride outside the cell
- [K+]in = concentration of potassium inside the cell
- [Na+]in = concentration of sodium inside the cell
- [Cl-]in = concentration of cloride inside the cell
- P_K+ = relative permeability of the cell membrane to potassium in relation to potassium
- P_Na+ = relative permeability of the cell membrane to sodium in relation to potassium
- P_Cl- = relative permeability of the cell membrane to cloride in relation to potassium
- P_anion = relative permeability of the cell membrane to the monovalent anion in relation to an ion

The resting membrane potential is the electrical potential difference across an membrane not conducting action potentials.
